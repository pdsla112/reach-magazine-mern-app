# reach-magazine-mern-app

This is a repository that contains my code for a MERN web application that I developed for a student newspaper start-up at my university.
I used MongoDB and MongoDB Atlas for the databases. Note: this web application is not a real, functioning online newspaper! See this newspaper as a 
fun project that shows some of the amazing possibilities of using MERN technologies.

The web application might take some time to load when you first enter depending
on where you are located on Earth and whether if you have any history of getting on my website. The website uses cookie if you login to your account.
The link is: https://polar-cove-87626.herokuapp.com/

If you want to see soem of the content-management capabilities of the web application, login to the account using these login credentials:
username: genesis
password: genesis

Then, see some of the new functionalities under the "CMS" section of the sidebar.

Enjoy!
